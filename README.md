# Just Some Movies
Just Some Movies is a project built with React, Express, and MySQL. It is an IMDb clone that allows users to interact with a database of Movies, Actors, Directors, Producers, and Production Team Members. Users can filter by movies and actors; sort by title, rating, budget, and release date for movies, sort by name, date of birth, and id for actors.
